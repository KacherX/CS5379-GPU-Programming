CS5379-GPU-Programming:

This repository contains high-performance parallel computing projects developed for CS5379 – Parallel & GPU Programming. Each folder demonstrates a different parallel programming model—CUDA, MPI, and OpenMPI—applied to matrix multiplication and Gaussian elimination. The goal is to explore how computation scales across GPUs and distributed-memory systems.

1. CUDA_Matrix_Multiplication:

A CUDA-based implementation of matrix multiplication designed to run on NVIDIA GPUs.

2. MPI_Gaussian_Elimination_Matrix_Multiplication:

An MPI-based parallel implementation of Gaussian Elimination and matrix multiplication for distributed-memory systems.

3. OpenMPI_Gaussian_Elimination_Matrix_Multiplication:

An extended version of the MPI project, built and tested using OpenMPI.
